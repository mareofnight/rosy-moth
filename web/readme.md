This is a website for finding fabric and craft supplies by color.
Version 1 will accept a color as input, and output the closest matching fabrics from the database.

Possible future features include:
* better color input (javascript color picker and/or multiple text formats)
* automatically picking colors from a photo
* suggesting color schemes based on the colors of the materials you have

If you\'d like to use this code, please ask; I\'ll probably be open to it.
(Once this is more developed, I\'ll consider breaking the most
reusable parts of this out into a separate library,
and open-sourcing it.)
